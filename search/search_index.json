Lua engine The Lua engine that's being used is LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3. The Lua 5.1 user manual and LuaJIT user manual are recommended reads. In particular, the bindings heavily make use of LuaJIT's FFI capabilities, which allows for direct memory access within the emulator's process. This means there is little protection against dramatic crashes the LuaJIT FFI engine can cause into the emulator's process, and the user must pay extra attention while manipulating FFI objects. Despite that, the code tries as much as possible to sandbox what the Lua code does, and will prevent crashes on any recoverable exception, including OpenGL and ImGui exceptions. Lua console All of the messages coming from Lua should display into the Lua console directly. The input text there is a single line execution, so the user can type one-liner Lua statements and get an immediate result. Lua editor The editor allows for more complex, multi-line statements to be written, such as complete functions. The editor will by default auto save its contents on the disc under the filename pcsx.lua , which can potentially be a problem if the last statement typed crashed the emulator, as it'll be reloaded on the next startup. It might become necessary to either edit the file externally, or simply delete it to recover from this state. The auto-execution of the editor permits for rapid development loop, with immediate feedback of what's done. API Basic Lua The LuaJIT extensions are fully loaded, and can be used globally. Most of the standard Lua libraries are loaded, and are usable. The require keyword however doesn't exist at the moment. As a side-effect of Luv, Lua-compat-5.3 is loaded. Dear ImGui A good portion of ImGui is bound to the Lua environment, and it's possible for the Lua code to emit arbitrary widgets through ImGui. It is advised to consult the user manual of ImGui in order to properly understand how to make use of it. The list of current bindings can be found within the source code . Some usage examples will be provided within the case studies. OpenGL OpenGL is bound directly to the Lua API through FFI bindings, loosely inspired and adapted from LuaJIT-OpenCL . Some usage examples can be seen in the CRT-Lottes shader configuration page. Luv For network access and interaction, PCSX-Redux uses libuv internally, and this is exposed to the Lua API through Luv Zlib The Zlib C-API is exposed through FFI bindings . PCSX-Redux ImGui interaction PCSX-Redux will periodically try to call the Lua function DrawImguiFrame to allow the Lua code to draw some widgets on screen. The function will be called exactly once per actual UI frame draw, which, when the emulator is running, will correspond to the emulated GPU's vsync. If the function throws an exception however, it will be disabled until recompiled with new code. Memory and registers The Lua code can access the emulated memory and registers directly through some FFI bindings: PCSX.getMemPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 8MB of emulated memory. This can be written to, but careful about the emulated i-cache in case code is being written to. PCSX.getRomPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 512kB of the BIOS memory space. This can be written to. PCSX.getScratchPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 1kB for the scratchpad memory space. PCSX.getRegisters() will return a structured cdata representing all the registers present in the CPU: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 typedef union { struct { uint32_t r0 , at , v0 , v1 , a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ; uint32_t t0 , t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , t5 , t6 , t7 ; uint32_t s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ; uint32_t t8 , t9 , k0 , k1 , gp , sp , s8 , ra ; uint32_t lo , hi ; } n ; uint32_t r [ 34 ]; } psxGPRRegs ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP0Regs ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP2Data ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP2Ctrl ; typedef struct { psxGPRRegs GPR ; psxCP0Regs CP0 ; psxCP2Data CP2D ; psxCP2Ctrl CP2C ; uint32_t pc ; } psxRegisters ; Execution flow The Lua code has the following 4 API functions available to it in order to control the execution flow of the emulator: PCSX.pauseEmulator() PCSX.resumeEmulator() PCSX.softResetEmulator() PCSX.hardResetEmulator() Messages The globals print and printError are available, and will display logs in the Lua Console. You can also use PCSX.log to display a line in the general Log window. All three functions should behave the way you'd expect from a print function in Lua. GUI You can move the cursor within the assembly window and the first memory view using the following two functions: PCSX.GUI.jumpToPC(pc) PCSX.GUI.jumpToMemory(address[, width]) Breakpoints If the debugger is activated, and while using the interpreter, the Lua code can insert powerful breakpoints using the following API: 1 PCSX . addBreakpoint ( address , type , width , cause , invoker ) Important : the return value of this function will be an object that represents the breakpoint itself. If this object gets garbage collected, the corresponding breakpoint will be removed. Thus it is important to store it somewhere that won't get garbage collected right away. The only mandatory argument is address , which will by default place an execution breakpoint at the corresponding address. The second argument type is an enum which can be represented by one of the 3 following strings: 'Exec' , 'Read' , 'Write' , and will set the breakpoint type accordingly. The third argument width is the width of the breakpoint, which indicates how many bytes should intersect from the base address with operations done by the emulated CPU in order to actually trigger the breakpoint. The fourth argument cause is a string that will be displayed in the logs about why the breakpoint triggered. It will also be displayed in the Breakpoint Debug UI. And the fifth and final argument invoker is a Lua function that will be called whenever the breakpoint is triggered. By default, this will simply call PCSX.pauseEmulator() . If the invoker returns false , the breakpoint will be permanently removed, permitting temporary breakpoints for example. The returned object will have a few methods attached to it: :disable() :enable() :isEnabled() :remove() A removed breakpoint will no longer have any effect whatsoever, and none of its methods will do anything. Remember it is possible for the user to still manually remove a breakpoint from the UI. Case studies Spyro: Year of the Dragon By looking up some of the gameshark codes for this game, we can determine the following memory addresses: 0x8007582c is the number of lives. 0x80078bbc is the health of Spyro. 0x80075860 is the number of unspent jewels available to the player. 0x80075750 is the number of dragons Spyro released so far. With this, we can build a small UI to visualize and manipulate these values in real time: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 -- Declare a helper function with the following arguments: -- mem: the ffi object representing the base pointer into the main RAM -- address: the address of the uint32_t to monitor and mutate -- name: the label to display in the UI -- min, max: the minimum and maximum values of the slider -- -- This function is local as to not pollute the global namespace. local function doSliderInt ( mem , address , name , min , max ) -- Clamping the address to the actual memory space, essentially -- removing the upper bank address using a bitmask. The result -- will still be a normal 32-bits value. address = bit . band ( address , 0x1fffff ) -- Computing the FFI pointer to the actual uint32_t location. -- The result will be a new FFI pointer, directly into the emulator's -- memory space, hopefully within normal accessible bounds. The -- resulting type will be a cdata[uint8_t*]. local pointer = mem + address -- Casting this pointer to a proper uint32_t pointer. pointer = ffi . cast ( 'uint32_t*' , pointer ) -- Reading the value in memory local value = pointer [ 0 ] -- Drawing the ImGui slider local changed changed , value = imgui .

Compiling Compiling PCSX-Redux Getting the sources The only location for the source is on github . Clone recursively, as the project uses submodules: git clone https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux.git --recursive . Windows Install Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition . Open the file vsprojects\\pcsx-redux.sln , select pcsx-redux -> pcsx-redux , right click, Set as Startup Project , and hit F7 to build. The project follows the open-and-build paradigm with no extra step, so no specific dependency ought to be needed, as NuGet will take care of downloading them automatically for you on the first build. Note: If you get an error saying hresult e_fail has been returned from a call to a com component , you might need to delete the .suo file in vsproject/vs, restart Visual Studio and retry. Openbios Using Visual Studio Code , one can use the task \"make_openbios\" to compile: CTRL-P then task make_openbios to compile. Linux Compiling with Docker Run ./dockermake.sh . You need docker for this to work. 1 2 3 4 # Debian derivative; Ubuntu, Mint... sudo apt install docker # Arch derivative; Manjaro... sudo pacman -S docker You will also need a few libraries on your system for this to work. Check the Dockerfile for a list of library packages to install. Compiling with make Debian derivatives ( for full emulator compilation ): 1 sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git make pkg-config clang g++ g++-mipsel-linux-gnu cpp-mipsel-linux-gnu binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu libfreetype-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libglfw3-dev libswresample-dev libuv1-dev zlib1g-dev Arch derivatives : 1 sudo pacman -S clang git make pkg-config ffmpeg libuv zlib glfw-x11 curl xorg-server-xvfb You can then just enter the 'pcsx-redux' directory and compile without using docker with make . If you have a different mips compiler, you'll need to override some variables, such as PREFIX=mipsel-none-elf FORMAT=elf32-littlemips . Openbios Building OpenBIOS on Linux can be done with docker : ./dockermake.sh openbios , or using make , with the g++-mipsel-linux-gnu package installed ; make openbios . MacOS You need MacOS Catalina with the latest XCode to build, as well as a few homebrew packages. Run the brew installation script to get all the necessary dependencies. Run make to build. Compiling OpenBIOS will require a mips compiler, that you can generate using the following commands: Openbios 1 2 brew install ./tools/macos-mips/mipsel-none-elf-binutils.rb brew install ./tools/macos-mips/mipsel-none-elf-gcc.rb Then, you can compile OpenBIOS using make -C ./src/mips/openbios . Compiling PSX code If you're only interested in compiling psx code, you can clone the PCSX-Redux repo; 1 git clone https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux.git --recursive then install a mips toolchain and get the converted PsyQ libraries in the pcsx-redux/src/mips/psyq/ folder as per these instructions . You can also find the pre-compiled converted Psyq libraries online . Getting the toolchain on Windows Download the MIPS toolchain here : https://static.grumpycoder.net/pixel/mips/g++-mipsel-none-elf-10.3.0.zip and add the bin folder to your $PATH . You can test it's working by launching a command prompt and typing mipsel-none-elf-gcc.exe --version . If you get a message like mipsel-none-gnu-gcc (GCC) 10.3.0 , then it's working ! Getting the toolchain on GNU/Linux Debian derivative; Ubuntu, Mint... 1 sudo apt install g++-mipsel-linux-gnu cpp-mipsel-linux-gnu binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu Arch derivative; Manjaro... The mipsel environment can be installed from AUR : cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils and cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc using your AURhelper of choice: 1 trizen -S cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc Cli & flags Command Line Flags You can launch pcsx-redux with the following command line parameters: The parsing code doesn't care about the number of dashes in the parameter's flag, so '-' can be used as well as '--', or any number of dashes. Flag Meaning -dumpproto Dump the protobuf schemas for PCSX-Redux on stdout and exit immediately. -run Begin execution immediately on startup. -stdout Redirect log output to stdout. -lua_stdout Redirect Lua's console output to stdout. -logfile Specify a file to log output to. -bios Specify a BIOS file. -testmode Interpret internal API 's pcsx_exit() command and close the emulator. -exe Load a PSX exe. -loadexe Load a PSX exe. -iso Load a PSX disk image (iso, bin/cue). -loadiso Load a PSX disk image (iso, bin/cue). -memcard1 Specify a memory card file to use as memory card slot 1. -memcard2 Specify a memory card file to use as memory card slot 2. -pcdrv Enable the pcdrv device interface. (Access PC filesystem through SIO). -pcdrvbase Specify base directory for pcdrv. -safe Resets configuration to defaults. -interpreter Use the interpreter CPU core. -dynarec Use the dynamic recompiler CPU core. ## Gdb-server GDB server The GDB server allows you to set breakpoints and control your PSX program's execution from your gdb compatible IDE.

Thus the need to use a custom crt0.s if you plan on running your code on real hardware.

This allows the use of a REST api to access various features. Activation You can activate the web server by going to Configuration > Emulation > Enable Web Server REST API By default, the server listens for incoming connection on localhost:8080 . URL Function http://localhost:8080/api/v1/gpu/vram/raw Dump VRAM http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cpu/ram/raw Dump RAM Lua Lua API PCSX-Redux features a Lua API that's available through either a direct Lua console, or a Lua editor, both available through the Debug menu. Lua engine The Lua engine that's being used is LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3. The Lua 5.1 user manual and LuaJIT user manual are recommended reads. In particular, the bindings heavily make use of LuaJIT's FFI capabilities, which allows for direct memory access within the emulator's process. This means there is little protection against dramatic crashes the LuaJIT FFI engine can cause into the emulator's process, and the user must pay extra attention while manipulating FFI objects. Despite that, the code tries as much as possible to sandbox what the Lua code does, and will prevent crashes on any recoverable exception, including OpenGL and ImGui exceptions. Lua console All of the messages coming from Lua should display into the Lua console directly. The input text there is a single line execution, so the user can type one-liner Lua statements and get an immediate result. Lua editor The editor allows for more complex, multi-line statements to be written, such as complete functions. The editor will by default auto save its contents on the disc under the filename pcsx.lua , which can potentially be a problem if the last statement typed crashed the emulator, as it'll be reloaded on the next startup. It might become necessary to either edit the file externally, or simply delete it to recover from this state. The auto-execution of the editor permits for rapid development loop, with immediate feedback of what's done. API Basic Lua The LuaJIT extensions are fully loaded, and can be used globally. Most of the standard Lua libraries are loaded, and are usable. The require keyword however doesn't exist at the moment. As a side-effect of Luv, Lua-compat-5.3 is loaded. Dear ImGui A good portion of ImGui is bound to the Lua environment, and it's possible for the Lua code to emit arbitrary widgets through ImGui. It is advised to consult the user manual of ImGui in order to properly understand how to make use of it. The list of current bindings can be found within the source code . Some usage examples will be provided within the case studies. OpenGL OpenGL is bound directly to the Lua API through FFI bindings, loosely inspired and adapted from LuaJIT-OpenCL . Some usage examples can be seen in the CRT-Lottes shader configuration page. Luv For network access and interaction, PCSX-Redux uses libuv internally, and this is exposed to the Lua API through Luv Zlib The Zlib C-API is exposed through FFI bindings . PCSX-Redux ImGui interaction PCSX-Redux will periodically try to call the Lua function DrawImguiFrame to allow the Lua code to draw some widgets on screen. The function will be called exactly once per actual UI frame draw, which, when the emulator is running, will correspond to the emulated GPU's vsync. If the function throws an exception however, it will be disabled until recompiled with new code. Memory and registers The Lua code can access the emulated memory and registers directly through some FFI bindings: PCSX.getMemPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 8MB of emulated memory. This can be written to, but careful about the emulated i-cache in case code is being written to. PCSX.getRomPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 512kB of the BIOS memory space. This can be written to. PCSX.getScratchPtr() will return a cdata[uint8_t*] representing up to 1kB for the scratchpad memory space. PCSX.getRegisters() will return a structured cdata representing all the registers present in the CPU: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 typedef union { struct { uint32_t r0 , at , v0 , v1 , a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ; uint32_t t0 , t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , t5 , t6 , t7 ; uint32_t s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ; uint32_t t8 , t9 , k0 , k1 , gp , sp , s8 , ra ; uint32_t lo , hi ; } n ; uint32_t r [ 34 ]; } psxGPRRegs ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP0Regs ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP2Data ; typedef union { uint32_t r [ 32 ]; } psxCP2Ctrl ; typedef struct { psxGPRRegs GPR ; psxCP0Regs CP0 ; psxCP2Data CP2D ; psxCP2Ctrl CP2C ; uint32_t pc ; } psxRegisters ; Execution flow The Lua code has the following 4 API functions available to it in order to control the execution flow of the emulator: PCSX.pauseEmulator() PCSX.resumeEmulator() PCSX.softResetEmulator() PCSX.hardResetEmulator() Messages The globals print and printError are available, and will display logs in the Lua Console. You can also use PCSX.log to display a line in the general Log window. All three functions should behave the way you'd expect from a print function in Lua. GUI You can move the cursor within the assembly window and the first memory view using the following two functions: PCSX.GUI.jumpToPC(pc) PCSX.GUI.jumpToMemory(address[, width]) Breakpoints If the debugger is activated, and while using the interpreter, the Lua code can insert powerful breakpoints using the following API: 1 PCSX . addBreakpoint ( address , type , width , cause , invoker ) Important : the return value of this function will be an object that represents the breakpoint itself. If this object gets garbage collected, the corresponding breakpoint will be removed. Thus it is important to store it somewhere that won't get garbage collected right away. The only mandatory argument is address , which will by default place an execution breakpoint at the corresponding address. The second argument type is an enum which can be represented by one of the 3 following strings: 'Exec' , 'Read' , 'Write' , and will set the breakpoint type accordingly. The third argument width is the width of the breakpoint, which indicates how many bytes should intersect from the base address with operations done by the emulated CPU in order to actually trigger the breakpoint. The fourth argument cause is a string that will be displayed in the logs about why the breakpoint triggered. It will also be displayed in the Breakpoint Debug UI. And the fifth and final argument invoker is a Lua function that will be called whenever the breakpoint is triggered. By default, this will simply call PCSX.pauseEmulator() . If the invoker returns false , the breakpoint will be permanently removed, permitting temporary breakpoints for example. The returned object will have a few methods attached to it: :disable() :enable() :isEnabled() :remove() A removed breakpoint will no longer have any effect whatsoever, and none of its methods will do anything. Remember it is possible for the user to still manually remove a breakpoint from the UI. Case studies Spyro: Year of the Dragon By looking up some of the gameshark codes for this game, we can determine the following memory addresses: 0x8007582c is the number of lives. 0x80078bbc is the health of Spyro. 0x80075860 is the number of unspent jewels available to the player. 0x80075750 is the number of dragons Spyro released so far. With this, we can build a small UI to visualize and manipulate these values in real time: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 -- Declare a helper function with the following arguments: -- mem: the ffi object representing the base pointer into the main RAM -- address: the address of the uint32_t to monitor and mutate -- name: the label to display in the UI -- min, max: the minimum and maximum values of the slider -- -- This function is local as to not pollute the global namespace. local function doSliderInt ( mem , address , name , min , max ) -- Clamping the address to the actual memory space, essentially -- removing the upper bank address using a bitmask. The result -- will still be a normal 32-bits value. address = bit . band ( address , 0x1fffff ) -- Computing the FFI pointer to the actual uint32_t location. -- The result will be a new FFI pointer, directly into the emulator's -- memory space, hopefully within normal accessible bounds. The -- resulting type will be a cdata[uint8_t*]. local pointer = mem + address -- Casting this pointer to a proper uint32_t pointer. pointer = ffi . cast ( 'uint32_t*' , pointer ) -- Reading the value in memory local value = pointer [ 0 ] -- Drawing the ImGui slider local changed changed , value = imgui . SliderInt ( name , value , min , max , '%d' ) -- The ImGui Lua binding will first return a boolean indicating -- if the user moved the slider. The second return value will be -- the new value of the slider if it changed. Therefore we can -- reassign the pointer accordingly. if changed then pointer [ 0 ] = value end end -- Utilizing the DrawImguiFrame periodic function to draw our UI. -- We are declaring this function global so the emulator can -- properly call it periodically. function DrawImguiFrame () -- This is typical ImGui paradigm to display a window local show = imgui . Begin ( 'Spyro internals' , true ) if not show then imgui . End () return end -- Grabbing the pointer to the main RAM, to avoid calling -- the function for every pointer we want to change. -- Note: it's not a good idea to hold onto this value between -- calls to the Lua VM, as the memory can potentially move -- within the emulator's memory space. local mem = PCSX . getMemPtr () -- Now calling our helper function for each of our pointer. doSliderInt ( mem , 0x8007582c , 'Lives' , 0 , 9 ) doSliderInt ( mem , 0x80078bbc , 'Health' , - 1 , 3 ) doSliderInt ( mem , 0x80075860 , 'Jewels' , 0 , 65000 ) doSliderInt ( mem , 0x80075750 , 'Dragons' , 0 , 70 ) -- Don't forget to close the ImGui window. imgui . End () end You can see this code in action in this demo video . Openbios Openbios Openbios is, as its name implies, an open-source alternative to a retail PSX bios that can be non-trivial to dump. Purposes of Openbios Educational Ease of distribution Automated testing See this page for more details. Building It is compiled together with pcsx-redux or can be compiled on its own. See the corresponding sections in Compiling for instructions. The result of the compilation should be a file called openbios.elf that contains all useful debugging symbols, and a file called openbios.bin which can be used in emulators or even burned to a chip and placed on a retail console. Status This subproject is still under construction, but is fairly functional and usable. OpenBIOS does almost all the same things as the retail BIOS does when booting, and implements most of its features. Many games are booting and working properly with this code. It can be used in emulators or on the real console, either while replacing the rom chip, or by using the \"cart\" build and programming the flash chip of a cheat cart with the result. Organization The BIOS is split in two major parts: the low level code for the bios itself, and the shell, which is the binary that's being loaded into memory at boot time by the bios, to display the SONY sound and logo, and has a small utility menu for playing audio discs, or shuffling around memory cards. While the first part is the main one that's being targeted here, the second one isn't currently present. This may change in the future, but this isn't currently the focus of this project. The original code was most likely chunked into several sub-projects, that were all linked together like a giant patchwork. This approach is less readable, and for this reason, we're not going to do this. However this will result in the ROM/RAM split to be less obvious, and slower at times than the original. Tuning of the hot functions is eventually required. Technicalities The code has been rewritten based off the reverse engineering of a dump of the BIOS of an american SCPH-7001 machine. MD5sum: 1e68c231d0896b7eadcad1d7d8e76129 The ghidra database for it is currently being hosted on a server, alongside a few other pieces of software being reversed. Contact one of the authors if you want access. Commentary The retail PlayStation BIOS code is a constellation of bugs and bad design. The fact that the retail console boots at all is nothing short of a miracle. Half of the provided libc in the A0 table is buggy. The BIOS code is barely able to initialize the CD-Rom, and read the game's binary off of it to boot it; anything beyond that will be crippled with bugs. And this only is viable if you respect a very strict method to create your CD-Rom. The memory card and gamepad code is a steaming-hot heap of human excrement. The provided GPU stubs are inefficient at best. The only sane thing that any software running on the PlayStation ought to do is to immediately disable interrupts, grab the function pointer located at 0x00000310 for FlushCache , in order put it inside a wrapper that disables interrupts before calling it, and then trash the whole memory to install its own code. The only reason FlushCache is required from the retail code is because since the function will unplug the main memory bus off the CPU in order to work, it HAS to run from the 0xbfc memory map, which will still be connected. Anything else from the retail code is virtually useless, and shouldn't be relied upon. Legality Disclaimer: the author is not a lawyer, and the following statement hasn't been reviewed by a professional of the law, so the rest of this document cannot be taken as legal advice. As explained above, this code has been written using disassembly and reverse engineering of a retail bios the author dumped from a second hand console. The same exact methodology was employed by Connectix for their PS1 bios. The conclusion of their lawsuit , and that of Sega v. Accolade seems to indicate that this project here follows and is impacted by the same doctrine.","title":"One"},{"location":"one/#menus","text":"","title":"Menus"},{"location":"one/#pcsx-redux-menus","text":"The menu bar holds some informations : CPU mode Game ID ImGui FPS counter (not psx internal fps)","title":"PCSX-Redux menus"},{"location":"one/#file","text":"Open ISO Close ISO Load Binary Dump save state proto schema Save state slots Load state slots Save global state Load global state Open Lid : Simulate open lid Close Lid : Simulate closed lid Open and Close Lid : Simulate opening then closing the lid MC1 inserted: Insert or remove Memory Card 1 MC2 inserted: Insert or remove Memory Card 2 Reboot : Restart emulator Quit","title":"File"},{"location":"one/#emulation","text":"Start (F5): Start execution Pause (F6): Pause execution Soft reset (F8): Calls Redux's CPU reset function, which jumps to the BIOS entrypoint (0xBFC00000), resets some COP0 registers and the general purpose registers, and resets some IO.

The third argument width is the width of the breakpoint, which indicates how many bytes should intersect from the base address with operations done by the emulated CPU in order to actually trigger the breakpoint. The fourth argument cause is a string that will be displayed in the logs about why the breakpoint triggered. It will also be displayed in the Breakpoint Debug UI.
